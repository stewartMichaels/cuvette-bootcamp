## ‚≠êÔ∏è _Day 2_

### üëâ _Basics of Programming_

Was explained a few concepts and was given an overview of the programming concepts like how to use flowcharts, conditional statements, operators etc.

We were also showed how to find if a number is even or odd (which is again a very basic concept). And we were also given a short explanation about Runtime Errors and Syntax/Compiler Errors.

That's all.

(I'm still waiting to start w/ the programming! ;-;)
